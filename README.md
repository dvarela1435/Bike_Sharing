## Summary: 

A bike-sharing program works for New York City. The month of August was used because it has the most rideable days in the year. The majority of the riders are males with 65% of the users. Women are 25% and the rest are undeclared genders with 10%.  The majority of the user will utilize the bicycles during the 8 AM time, which is probably during the time going to work. The other times are from 4 PM - 7 PM which are those heading home. The majority time usage is about 5 minutes. When broken down by gender, males used it for 5 minutes, women use it for 6 minutes, and the undeclared used the bike for 10 minutes. Comparing the heatmap, the busiest days are between Monday through Friday during the hours of 8 AM and 4 PM - 7 PM.  Saturdays are also a busy day, but they spread more evenly and no hour is a busy time. 
The best bet to use this program will be to use the subscriber's plan because the majority of the user were subscribers.
